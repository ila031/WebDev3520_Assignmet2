                    I am Ram, the prince of Ayodhya. I am the eldest son of King Dasharatha and Queen Kaushalya.
                    My life is a journey of love, sacrifice, and unwavering duty. 
                    However, at its core, it is a story of Sita. A woman who stood by me, even when times were dark.

                    I first saw Sita when she was stepping into a courtyard. The only way I could
