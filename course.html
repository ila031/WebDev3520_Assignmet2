                   Myths of India 3580. Offered students a journey into the heart
                   indian mythology. The course was very story and myth heavy.
                   The course studied divine and semi-divine figures and their stories.
                   Furthermore, their symbolic meaning to the Hindu tradition.
                   The website focuses on one story we learned about in this class.
                   The story of Ram and Sita. Ram is a avatar of the god Vishnu.

                I chose this topic and course to create a website on
                becase I felt as I had a lot of concpets and ideas to work with.
                I believed that there was many ways I could take this assignment
                and be the most creative.
                I also learned a lot form this class and it taught me to 
                be thankful for the stories our parents and grandparents tell us.
                Furthermore, it also taught me how powerful storytelling can be.
